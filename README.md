# Tableau Permissions
This PHP sample code uses Tableaus REST API to create csv files that describe the permissions on workbooks and datasources. Permissions are broken down to FINAL permissions, which summarize what a user can do, and DETAIL permissions, that show the underlying permisions that were evaluated to get to the FINAL permission.
